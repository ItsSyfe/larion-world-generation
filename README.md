# Larion


Datapack for Minecraft 1.20.4 that drastically alters world generation. The goal
was a mix of epic fantasy terrain and old alpha Minecraft weirdness.

## Requirements

Larion **requires** the
[More Density Functions](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-density-functions)
Fabric mod in order to function, as several important features make use of the
"sine" and "x" functions added by this mod.
