# Larion


Datapack for Minecraft 1.20.4 that drastically alters world generation. The goal
was a mix of epic fantasy terrain and old alpha Minecraft weirdness.

## Requirements

Larion **requires** the [More Density
Functions](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-density-functions) Fabric mod in order
to function. Functions such as sine and power are essential for this datapack.

## Features

- **An oceanic world** with landmasses of different sizes. Tiny islands,
archipelagos and continents that are sometimes 1, sometimes 5 square kilometers
in size. Occasionally, landsasses contain "lakes" that are really just small
blobs of ocean.
- **A mountainous world** where jagged, snowy and stony peaks generally appear inland and flatter
biomes such as swamps and plains appear at the edges. In general, expect way more and way
stranger hills - some extra random noise has been blended into the terrain in a
similar way to how it was done in Minecraft Alpha. This means floating islands,
blob-like cliffs and overhangs.
- **Temperature bands**, meaning it gets colder as you head north and warmer as
  you head south, giving temperature distribution a more earth-like
structure. Combined with a heavily altered humidity and erosion noises, biomes
are much smaller and oddly shaped in general, but in rare cases larger than vanilla.
- **Long, branching rivers**, thanks to the amazing
[Eldor](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/eldor/) datapack, combined
with **river tunnels and saddle valleys** from the [Saddle Valley
Rivers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/saddle-valley-rivers-canyons-and-underground-rivers-1-18-2-only/)
datapack. Rivers will never be buried beneath terrain; in 99% of cases you can
follow them all the way though any kind of continent.
- **Deeper Oceans** thanks to [this datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/deeper-oceans) - tweaked to be just slightly less deep.
